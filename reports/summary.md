# Executive Summary (Draft Template)

## Overview

Summarize the project goal: interpret volatility regimes in equity markets by separating mean return dynamics from conditional volatility.

## Data & Scope

- SPX daily closes for returns
- VIX daily closes for implied volatility
- Time horizon: at least 10–20 years covering multiple regimes

## Key Findings

- **Volatility regimes:** Describe low- and high-volatility periods.
- **Persistence:** Summarize `α + β` and implications for shock decay.
- **Implied vs realized:** Note where VIX diverges from realized risk.

## Diagnostics Summary

- Stationarity: ADF results on returns.
- Mean process: ARMA order selection and residual checks.
- Variance process: GARCH diagnostics and adequacy.

## Risk Interpretation

Explain how regime shifts affect risk perception and valuation confidence.

## Resume-Ready Bullets

- Modeled equity market volatility using ARMA–GARCH to identify regime shifts and volatility persistence across market conditions.
- Compared realized and implied volatility to interpret risk dynamics and stress sensitivity.
