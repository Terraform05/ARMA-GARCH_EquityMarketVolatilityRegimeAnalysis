# Regime Interpretation

## Objective

Interpret volatility regimes and compare implied vs realized volatility.

## Conditional Volatility Regimes

- Plot conditional volatility over time.
- Identify low-, high-, and transitional volatility regimes.
- Align regimes with known market stress events.

## Implied vs Realized Volatility

- Compare VIX to realized volatility proxy (squared returns or rolling variance).
- Highlight periods where VIX over- or understates realized risk.

## Interpretation Prompts

- What do persistent high-vol regimes imply for risk perception?
- When does implied volatility diverge from realized risk?

## Output

- Regime plots.
- VIX vs realized volatility plot.
- Short narrative interpretation.
