# Model Validation

## Objective

Confirm adequacy of the mean and variance specifications using residual diagnostics.

## Residual Diagnostics

- Ljung–Box test on standardized residuals.
- Ljung–Box test on squared standardized residuals.
- Check remaining ARCH effects.

## Expected Outcomes

- No significant autocorrelation in standardized residuals.
- Minimal remaining ARCH effects after GARCH fit.

## Output

- Test statistics and p-values.
- Summary narrative on model adequacy.
