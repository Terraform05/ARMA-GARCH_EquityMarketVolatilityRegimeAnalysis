# Preliminary Diagnostics

## Objective

Justify ARMA for the mean and GARCH for the variance using stationarity and autocorrelation diagnostics.

## Stationarity

- Run Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test on SPX log returns.
- Record the test statistic, p-value, and conclusion.

## Autocorrelation

- Plot ACF/PACF for returns.
- Identify candidate ARMA(p, q) orders for the mean process.

## Volatility Clustering

- Plot returns and squared returns.
- Highlight periods of clustering to motivate conditional heteroskedasticity.

## Output

- Diagnostic plots (ACF/PACF, return series, squared returns).
- Short narrative linking diagnostics to model choice.
